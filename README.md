Usage
-----
This tutorial is ment to be used inconjunction with github.com. Each lesson is a different branch within the repository. It's very easy to traverse the lessons though the TOC in the master branch.

Goals & Expectations
--------------------
You are expected to have a working knowledge of javascript. Idealy, you've read [Douglas Crockford's 'Javascript: The Good Parts'](http://amzn.to/1jE2hsA). It's less than 200 pages of great content. And a great baseline of knowledge that every frontend developer should know. 

The goal of these tutorials is to help you understand the inner workings of backbone. Understand how these pieces fit together and how to create complete robust solutions using not only backbone but also help and adjacent technologies like requirejs, handlebars and bower.

At the end of this tutorial you'll be able to integrate models and collections with a 3rd party REST API. Render your models and collections with views driven by handlebar based templates. Finally you will be introduced to Test Driven Development and a simple implementation using javascript tools.
