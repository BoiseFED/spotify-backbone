Intro
=====

Usage
-----
This tutorial is ment to be used inconjunction with github.com. Each lesson is a different branch within the repository. It's very easy to traverse the lessons though the TOC in the master branch.

Goals & Expectations
--------------------
You are expected to have a working knowledge of javascript. Idealy, you've read [Douglas Crockford's 'Javascript: The Good Parts' (amazon)](http://amzn.to/1jE2hsA). It's less than 200 pages of great content. And a great baseline of knowledge that every frontend developer should know. 

The goal of these tutorials is to help you understand the inner workings of backbone. Understand how these pieces fit together and how to create complete robust solutions using not only backbone but also help and adjacent technologies like requirejs, handlebars and bower.

At the end of this tutorial you'll be able to integrate models and collections with a 3rd party REST API. Render your models and collections with views driven by handlebar based templates. Finally you will be introduced to Test Driven Development and a simple implementation using javascript tools.


What is Backbone
----------------
I don't think it can be said any better then Addy Osmani said it in his book [Developing Backbone.js Applications (foss book)](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals).

Go check out his [introduction](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#introduction) and [fundamentals](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#fundamentals) and then come right back.

Getting Started
---------------
First off, you'll need `git`. You can find a good tutorial provided by github.

[Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

Now that you have git installed you need to clone the lessons. The repository address is
`git@github.com:BoiseFED/spotify-backbone.git`. 

If you're using commandline git you can copy and paste the following command.

```
git clone git@github.com:BoiseFED/spotify-backbone.git
``` 

You'll need to cd into the directory

```
cd spotify-backbone
```

Now we need to checkout `lesson1`. 

```
git checkout lesson1
```

At this point you can open `README.md` or you can continue on to [lesson 1: what is a model](https://github.com/BoiseFED/spotify-backbone/tree/lesson1)
